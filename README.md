# QA Portfolio — Shaun

A curated collection of my QA work showcasing how I test, document, automate, and break software with intention. This portfolio highlights my approach to quality engineering across manual testing, bug reporting, API validation, and automation.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

### 1. Test Cases (/test-cases) 🧪
Structured, step‑by‑step test cases written using industry‑standard formatting.
* **Featured Examples:** [Link to Case A], [Link to Case B]
* **Key Focus:** * Clear preconditions and environment setup.
    * Repeatable, logical steps.
    * Expected vs. actual results mapping.
    * Deep edge case and boundary value analysis.



### 2. Bug Reports (/bug-reports) 🪲
Realistic bug reports written in a developer‑friendly, reproducible format.
* **Featured Examples:** [Link to Bug A], [Link to Bug B]
* **Report Components:**
    * **Title & Severity:** Instantly identifies the problem and urgency.
    * **Environment Details:** OS, Browser, and Versioning.
    * **Steps to Reproduce:** No-guesswork instructions.
    * **Evidence:** Screenshots, GIFs, or console logs.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Suggested fix direction where applicable.

### 3. API Testing (/api-testing) 🚀
A Postman collection demonstrating robust backend validation.
* **Capabilities:** CRUD testing, Auth flows, and Negative testing.
* **Technical Highlights:** Response validation scripts, environment variables, and chained requests.
* **Files:** `postman-collection.json` and visual run results.



### 4. Automation Demo (/automation-demo) ⚙️
A Cypress automation project demonstrating scalable script architecture.
* **Design Patterns:** Page Object Model (POM) structure for maintainability.
* **Best Practices:** Reusable selectors, custom commands, and test data separation (fixtures).
* **Setup:** Includes a CI-friendly folder layout and a `README.md` for local execution.

## 🧠 How I Think as a Tester
My testing philosophy is built on **clarity**, **reproducibility**, and **risk‑based prioritization**.

### 🔍 I test with intention
I don’t just check functionality — I analyze:
* **User flows** – Mapping the actual journey of the end-user.
* **Edge cases** – Investigating the "what-ifs" at the boundaries.
* **Failure points** – Identifying where the architecture is most vulnerable.
* **Business impact** – Prioritizing bugs that affect the bottom line.

### 🧪 I break things systematically
Every test is designed to answer:
* **The Unexpected:** What happens if the user does something unexpected?
* **The Stress:** What happens when the system is stressed?
* **The Integrity:** What happens when data is invalid or missing?

### 📊 I communicate like a developer
My bug reports are **precise**, **reproducible**, and **actionable**. 
> *Engineers should never have to guess what went wrong.*

### ⚙️ I automate where it matters
Automation is not about replacing manual testing — it’s about:
* **Reducing repetitive work** – Freeing up time for exploratory testing.
* **Increasing coverage** – Ensuring stability across environments.
* **Catching regressions early** – Providing fast feedback loops.

### 📈 I improve continuously
I treat QA as a craft. Every project is an opportunity to refine:
* My test design & automation patterns.
* My documentation clarity.
* My communication with cross-functional teams.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Portfolio
This repository exists to demonstrate my technical depth, my testing discipline, and my readiness for high-impact QA roles.

### 🎯 Objectives
* **Technical Depth:** Showcasing hands-on experience with modern tools like Cypress, Postman, and GitHub Actions.
* **Testing Discipline:** Demonstrating that I move beyond "happy path" testing into edge cases and failure analysis.
* **Clear Communication:** Proving that I can bridge the gap between QA, Engineering, and Product through precise documentation.
* **Market Readiness:** Tailored for the high standards of **Toronto’s tech ecosystem**.

### 🤝 Targeted For
* **Recruiters:** To quickly verify skill alignment and core competencies.
* **Hiring Managers:** To see my systematic approach to problem-solving.
* **Senior QA Leads:** To review my code quality, automation patterns, and test architecture.
